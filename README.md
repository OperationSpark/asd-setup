# Set up your Github / Gitpod Workspace

Below, you will find instructions for creating a github repository and setting up your Gitpod workspace. Read all instructions carefully before moving on. If you get stuck, encounter an issue, or simply need help, reach out to your instructor immediately.

## 0) Pre-requisites:

Before continuing on to the next steps, make sure that you have done the following:
* Created a personal email account on Gmail.
* Created an account on Greenlight
* Created an account on GitHub
* Created an account on Gitpod
* Joined the Operation Spark GitHub Team

All of the above should already have been done if you are in the advanced course, but if they are not, see the <a href="https://github.com/OperationSpark/fsd-setup">fsd-setup instructions</a> for how to do so.

## 1) Install your projects

Open your Gitpod workspace. With your workspace open, find the bash terminal and enter these commands one at a time:
* `git clone https://github.com/OperationSpark/asd-setup.git`
* `chmod +x asd-setup/setup.sh`
* `./asd-setup/setup.sh`
* `rm -rf ./asd-setup`


## 2) Push your code

Down in the bash terminal, enter these commands:

`git add -A`

`git commit -m "adding ASD projects"`

`git push`
